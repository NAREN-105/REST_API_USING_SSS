# REST_API_USING_SSS
I HAVE DEVELOPED A PROJECT USING   **REST API**  WITH  **THREE**  ENDPOINTS  AND ALSO I HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE **SSS ( SHAMIR'S SECRET SHARING ALGORITHM )**
IN THIS ALGORITHM A SECRET IS SHARED AMONG THE **(n)** NO.OF PEOPLE  IN ORDER TO REVEAL OR FIND THE SECRET, THE ONE WHO SHARED THE SECRET THEY HAVE FIXED A **THRESHOLD VALUE(k)** IN ORDER TO REVEAL THE SECRET THERE MUST ME THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD (i.e) NO.OF PEOPLE LESS THAN THRESHOLD THEN THEY CANNOT ABLE TO REVEAL THE SECRET , **LAGRANGE INTERPOLATION** IS USED FOR THE RECONSTRUCTIION OF THE SECRET


## REQUIREMENTS TO UES THIS API: 
THE USER NEED TO SHARE THE SECRET VALUES AND THE (n) VALUE TOTAL SHARES AND ALSO THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD (k) 
AND AFTER THAT IT WILL GENERATE SHARES FOR EACH USER 


## END POINTS OF THE API: 
    1) **info**         -    INFORMATION OF THE API 
    2) **split**        -    USED TO SPLIT THE SECRET AMONG THE (n) VALUES 
    3) **reconstruct**  -    USING THE LAGRANGE INTERPOLATION IT WILL FIND OR RECONSTRUCT THE SECRET
