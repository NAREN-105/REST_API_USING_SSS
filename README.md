# REST_API_USING_SSS
I HAVE DEVELOPED A PROJECT USING REST API WITH THREE ENDPOINTS  AND ALSO I HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE SSS ( SHAMIR'S SECRET SHARING ALGORITHM )
IN THIS ALGORITHM A SECRET IS SHARED AMONG THE (n) NO.OF PEOPLE  IN ORDER TO REVEAL OR FIND THE SECRET, THE INE WHO SHARED THE SECRET THEY HAVE FIXED A THRESHOLD VALUE IN ORDER TO REVEAL THE SECRET THERE MUST ME THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD NO.OF PEOPLE LESS THAN THAT THEN THEY CANNOT ABLE TO REVEAL THE SECRET 
LAGRANGE INTERPOLATION IS USED FOR THE RECONSTRUCTIION OF THE SECRET
